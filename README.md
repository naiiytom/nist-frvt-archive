## Face Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT) Validation Packages
This repository contains validation packages for all [Ongoing FRVT evaluation](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/face-recognition-vendor-test-frvt-ongoing) tracks.
We recommend developers clone the entire repository and run validation from within
the folder that corresponds to the evaluation of interest.  The ./common directory
contains files that are shared across all validation packages.
